# slack-clone
Slack clone using React, Redux, Styled components and Firebase Hooks.

### To run the app, first you need to make project on firebase and after that, add firebaseConfig in /src/components/firebase.js based on parameters you got automatically after creating project on Firebase.

```
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'apiKey',
  authDomain: 'authDomain',
  projectId: 'projectId',
  storageBucket: 'storage bucket',
  messagingSenderId: 'messagingSenderId',
  appId: 'appId',
}
```

### You need to make sure that you enabled Google Authentication in Project Settings/Authentication on Firebase.

That's it...!
